# Prediction-Based-Server-Auto-provisioning-on-Cloud-Computing
This algorithm automatically provides EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instances to any application or web portal according to predefined usage logs of that particular application or web portal. I used Amazon Web Service to implement this algorithm. This algorithm also increases EC2 instance capacity during demand spikes to maintain performance and decreases capacity during lulls to reduce cost


After adding your credentials of Amazon Web Service you can start with start.jsp. 
Before that you need to create text file same as StoreDataNew.txt. This file is used to store and retrive data to make predictions.
